# The Art of Compression

The Art of Compression was a school project (or assignment, I would say) that a colleague and I did during Spring of 2019 while I was in an Computer Science Algorithms and Data Structures course. The project's objective was to create a C++ application that can manipulate images' pixels and their RBG values to create stunning mosaic-like effect.
